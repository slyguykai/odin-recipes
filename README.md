In this project, I will build a basic recipe website.

The site will include a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. This project is just to build my HTML chops; I'll revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS. Currently, simple styling is provided through style.css and recipes.css.

## Testing

Unit tests verify that every link in `index.html` points to an existing file in
the repository. To run the tests, execute:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```
